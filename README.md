This notebook serves as an introduction to conducting inference for organ segmentation in human body CT scans. This method holds significant potential across various applications, particularly in radiation therapy, where manual organ segmentation using mathematical tools is standard practice. However, leveraging AI can automate this process, offering more efficient segmentation.

The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from [TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/). With gratitude to [Monai (Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence)](https://monai.io/), a leading open-source platform, we'll employ a pre-trained model for inference.

The primary aim of this project is twofold: to grasp the computational intensity inherent in medical imaging research and to familiarize myself with all of Python packages commonly employed in such research interests..
